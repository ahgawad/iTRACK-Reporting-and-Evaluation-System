# iTRACK-Reporting-and-Evaluation-System
The integrated system evaluation framework is designed and implemented to assist in measuring the quality and usefulness of the iTRACK integrated system (https://www.itrack-project.eu) and similar systems, by proposing methods and metrics to evaluate the iTRACK system quality in terms of meeting the specified requirements as well as user satisfaction. The former is achieved via testing the software system against the requirements in terms of specifications, use cases, design documents, etc., while the latter is achieved via testing the iTRACK system components usability directly with users both in office and field settings, and subjectively via questionnaires to administered to these users. Lastly, the framework and implementation guide the measurement of the iTRACK system usefulness in terms of how the system is helping users in accomplishing their job tasks quicker, improving their job performance, productivity, effectiveness, and in general making their job easier. In other words, the framework will measure the enhancement in performance indicators as a result of using the iTRACK system.
